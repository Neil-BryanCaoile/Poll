# Poll
Developed an application that allows a user to respond to a poll of their choice, then show them the results of the poll they took. It displays a list of all available poll titles in a dropdown list so that the user can choose one by clicking a button. The user is then taken to a second page to take the poll by seeing the options, selecting their choice by clicking a button. After recording the userâ€™s response to the poll, it will take them to a third page where they can see the following information for the poll that they took.
